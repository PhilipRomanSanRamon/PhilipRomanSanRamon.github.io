This is my initial version of a website portfoilio, that will showcase what I have been doing over my academic career. This includes a list of my projects, my educations, as well as some other notable achievements and experiences.

This is an initial version that is used as an exmaple of my website, and not as a final product. My new version is currently being written in "React" and will be released soon. Till then, stay tuned!
