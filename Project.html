      <h1>Maker Faire Contest submission</h1>
      <h3>Automatic Room Cooler</h3>
      <p>Using an Arduino board as the platform, I coded a program that would track how hot my room is through the use of an heat sensor, and when it would reach a certain threshold, it would change the color of the RGB strip from blue to red, signifying that the temperature in my room has gotten to hot. As a result, this would this turn on a fan that would continue to run until the temperature within the room had returned back to normal. Once the temperature is back with a cooler range, the fan will turn off, with the RGB strip will returning back to blue, signifying that the room has returned back to normal conditions.</p>

      <h1>Tetrix Robotics </h1>
      <h3>Ball-Picking Robot</h3>
      <p>With this project, I had to create a robot that would serve as an example for a youth camp competition. I built a robot out of parts from a Tetrix Robotics kit and constructed a robot that I believed would be able to complete the task. I then coded its program in C++ in order for the robot to work with a controller and its servo motors. The robot is made to be able to move around a certain amount of space, drop its arms and pick up a ping-pong ball. It can is able to drive to the trash can and drop the ping-pong ball into the trash can, marking it as a point.</p>

      <h1>Assembly Code Project</h1>
      <h3>Binary Code Guessing Game</h3>
      <p>As part of a final project for my embedded systems class, I had to be able to implement certain functions learned in class through assembly code and apply them to a had made board. With this game, it will prompt the player to guess the binary-to-hex equivalent of the value that appears on the LEDs. It would then show a message to the user if they got it right or wrong, as well as a amount of time that passes while the user tries to guess that LED value.</p>
